# Chatbot-Sam---Intelligent-AI-Assistant-with-Web-Search-Capabilities
Chatbot Sam is a sophisticated conversational AI that blends neural network-based intent recognition with real-time web search functionality. Built with PyTorch and powered by sentence transformers, Sam can engage in natural conversations while fetching accurate information from Wikipedia and Google Search APIs.

Features

ü§ñ Core Chatbot Capabilities
Intent Recognition:    Uses neural network-based classification to understand user intents
Pattern Matching:      Handles common conversation patterns like greetings, farewells, compliments, and more
Contextual Responses:  Provides appropriate responses based on classified intents
Learning System:       Trained on custom intents dataset with expandable patterns

üîç Real-time Information Retrieval
Wikipedia Integration: Fetches summaries from Wikipedia API for factual queries
