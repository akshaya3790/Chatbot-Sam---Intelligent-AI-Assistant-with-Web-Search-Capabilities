# Chatbot-Sam---Intelligent-AI-Assistant-with-Web-Search-Capabilities
Chatbot Sam is a sophisticated conversational AI that blends neural network-based intent recognition with real-time web search functionality. Built with PyTorch and powered by sentence transformers, Sam can engage in natural conversations while fetching accurate information from Wikipedia and Google Search APIs.

Features

ü§ñ Core Chatbot Capabilities
1)Intent Recognition:    Uses neural network-based classification to understand user intents
2)Pattern Matching:      Handles common conversation patterns like greetings, farewells, compliments, and more
3)Contextual Responses:  Provides appropriate responses based on classified intents
4)Learning System:       Trained on custom intents dataset with expandable patterns

üîç Real-time Information Retrieval
1)Wikipedia Integration: Fetches summaries from Wikipedia API for factual queries
2)Google Search: Uses Google Custom Search API to find and scrape relevant information
3)Smart Response Generation: Combines multiple sources for comprehensive answers
4)Yes/No Detection: Intelligently detects questions requiring yes/no answers

üõ† Technical Features
1)PyTorch Neural Network: Custom-built feedforward neural network for intent classification
2)Sentence Transformers: Uses 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' for semantic text embeddings
